This is a summary of the analytic report of NYC Citi Bike program in order to help understand and prepare a bike-sharing business plan. A number of demographic and geographic data were used in this analysis. The Analysis was performed for investment on a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. An analysis was performed for August 2018. Several visualizations were created to show the potential of a similar program in Des Moines.

Total Number of Rides in August of 2018 taken by riders in New York was 2,344,224

## Top Location
Top starting location for rides in NYC for August, 2018 was the midtown area in Manhattan where tourist are the primary vistors. Similarly, more bike stations in Des Moines near tourist areas would make it profitable.

# Conclusion

Based on the visualizations and analysis, it can observed that there were 2 million riders during the month of August and it is definitely a peak season for city bikes. In additon, many of the rides are situated in a specific area, mostly toursit spots in downtown New York. The riders rent the bike for 5 hours typically. Men tend to rent them for a longer period of time. Also, it can be further noted that rush hours attract more riders during the weekdays and weekends. In additon, those who are a member of the bikesharing program usually ride a lot more.

For a future analysis, I would recommend the following:

What are the age gorups of the riders and their gender?
How long are the trip duraiton based on customer type (Basic Rider v. Subscriber)
Therefore, I would suggest that bike sharing is an inexpensive and easy-to-implement transportation option which can deliver a variety of benefits for Des Moines City.
